# HackerRank Python Solutions

## Repository Description
A collection of Python solutions to HackerRank problems, organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and category (Algorithms, Data Structures, Mathematics). Ideal for learning, practicing, and mastering Python programming and problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Welcome to **HackerRank Python Solutions**, a comprehensive collection of Python solutions to HackerRank problems. This repository is designed to help you learn, practice, and master Python programming through structured problem-solving. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, these solutions provide clear, efficient, and well-documented code to enhance your skills.

This repository contains solutions to a wide range of HackerRank problems, organized by:
- **Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Category**: Algorithms, Data Structures, Mathematics, and more

Each solution is written in Python and includes concise, readable code with comments where necessary to explain the logic. The goal is to provide a resource for learning Python, understanding algorithmic concepts, and preparing for coding interviews.

- **Easy**: Beginner-friendly problems to build foundational skills.
- **Medium**: Intermediate challenges to deepen problem-solving abilities.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems to test and refine expertise.
- **Category Folders**: Grouped by problem type (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures) for targeted practice.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/didogrigorov/Hackerrank-Python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Folder**:
   Browse the `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`, or category-specific folders to find problems of interest.

3. **Run a Solution**:
   Each `.py` file contains a standalone solution. Run it using Python:
   ```bash
   python Easy/Solve_Me_First.py
   ```

4. **Learn and Experiment**:
   - Read the code and comments to understand the solution.
   - Modify the code to test alternative approaches or optimize performance.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use This Repository

- **For Learning**: Study the solutions to understand Python syntax, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.
- **For Practice**: Attempt the problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) first, then compare your solution with the ones here.
- **For Interview Prep**: Use the categorized solutions to prepare for coding interviews by focusing on specific problem types or difficulty levels.
